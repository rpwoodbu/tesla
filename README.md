# Tesla Public Issue Tracker

This repo is to track issues (bugs and _especially_ feature requests) for Tesla vehicles that I (@rpwoodbu) would like to see implemented. I'm happy to discuss these with the public, and others are free to submit their own issues, but I will curate them using my own judgment and sensibilities. If you are looking for a public forum, there are lots of other places online for that.

I currently own a Tesla Model S 75D with Autopilot 2.5, so there will be a significant bias toward that model (although I believe most issues will apply to all).
